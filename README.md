# SuperMarco 

Welcome to **SuperMarco**! 🛒 This project was created as part of the Programming Language 2 subject at **Helwan University, Faculty of Computer and Artificial Intelligence**. 🎓✨

## About the Project 📜

SuperMarco is a **console-based application** developed in **Java** that integrates with an **SQLite database**. The application is designed to simulate a simplified inventory and employee management system. It allows for efficient handling of store operations with roles tailored for different employee types.

- Employees have specialized roles:
  - **Sales** employees focus on transactions and customer interaction.
  - **Marketing** employees handle promotional strategies.
  - **Inventory** employees oversee stock and supplies.

## Technologies Used 💻
